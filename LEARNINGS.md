- css reset

  - what is it and why it's awesome
- iframe
  - when to use it (scoping of styles for tools which render code from outside it's domain)
  - gotchas
  - how to use it with react
    - react-frame-component is awesome
- serializing javascript functions
  - JSON doesn't support javascript functions
  - i serialized functions as strings. That meant deserializing became a 2 step process. First do JSON.parse(serializedString), and then run another pass on each of the parsed entities to get the functions out specifically
- Write your own utility library for each of your side projects. Don't just import lodash or ramda. Writing the utility functions again and again is good javascript practice ;)
